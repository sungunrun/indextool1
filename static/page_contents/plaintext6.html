More specifically, I focus on perceptual representation. Perceptual representation is <br>
where representational mind begins. I reflect on the joint in nature between mind and the <br>
mindless by reflecting on differences between perceptual representation and those non-<br>
perceptual sensory capacities that underlie it. I center on perception—and related capaci<br>
ties like perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation—because it is functionally the <br>
most basic representational capacity. No other representational capacity evolved earlier. <br>
If other representational capacities \(perceptual memory, for example\volved equally <br>
early, they depend functionally on perception.<br>
<br>
Perception is, evolutionarily, the first known manifestation of representational mind. <br>
Arthropods—bees, praying mantises, and certain spiders—are known to have visual per-<br>
ception. Visual perception is distinct, in ways to be discussed, from other types of light-<br>
based sensing. Snails, molluscs, and tapeworms sense light, even light-direction. Ants <br>
respond to light-produced templates that correspond to surface shape.7<br>
for visual sensing are not perception. Snails and molluscs are not known to have visual <br>
perception. I think it unlikely that animals that evolved <i></i> earlier than the arthropods <br>
had perceptual representation. So we have a rough sense of where representational mind <br>
begins. It begins among the arthropods.8<br>
<br>
I do not center on the evolutionary emergence of representational mind, despite its <br>
great interest. My topic is different. Given that perception is the earliest form of represen-<br>
tation, and that other forms develop from it, what can be learned about representation and <br>
the earliest form of representational mind by reflecting on perception? I center on what <br>
perception is—its structure and function—not on how it evolved. Evolution will, however, <br>
recurrently come up.<br><br>
