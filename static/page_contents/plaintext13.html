The Fregean Source of Key Semantical Notions for Perception</b><br><br>

I wrote in the Preface that Gottlob Frege fashioned central theoretical semantical concepts <br>
that are relevant to understanding perception.9-<br>
tematized by philosophers and mathematical logicians through the twentieth century. The <br>
concepts have been applied to the semantics of natural language and thought.10<br>
appropriated the concepts from philosophy and mathematical logic in the 1970s.<br>
<br>
Frege was more concerned with mathematical thought than with language, let alone <br>
perception. Perception is not thought or language. It differs from both in fundamental <br>
ways. Still, four of his concepts are directly applicable to perceptual representation. <br>
I develop them, as they apply to perception, in Part II. I make some general points here.<br>
<br>
First, Frege’s understanding of predication, as functional application, took the key step <br>
in gaining a modern understanding of characterization, or attribution. Predication in lan-<br>
guage and conceptual attribution in thought are rooted in more primitive attribution in <br>
perception. Perceiving something as brown is perceptually characterizing it, making an <br>
attribution to it.<br>
<br>
As I use the term, <i></i> is attribution that functions to contribute to a propos<br>
itional structure. So predication is conceptual or linguistic attribution. <i></i> in per-<br>
ception is not predication. Perceptual states are not propositional. They do attribute <br>
properties, kinds, and relations. Properties, kinds, and relations are <i></i>. Perceptual <br>
states characterize entities that they function to represent by representing them as having <br>
attributes. I use ‘attribution’ to cover both predication and the purely reference-serving <br>
characterization in perception \(and in many uses of pictures\ So attribution, but not <br>
predication, occurs in perception.<br>
<br>
Second, Frege took the key step in achieving a modern understanding of reference—in <br>
particular the “picking out” of a particular entity. The key step was understanding how <br>
singular reference fits with predication to produce a complex representation. Frege’s <br>
notion of <i>Bedeutung</i>, one form of which is a type of reference, was a highly theoretical <br>
notion, fitted to the semantics of logic and mathematics. However, close examination of <br>
his informal explications of relevant forms of <i></i> \(forms for names\hows that, <br>
in forming his technical notion, he reflected on the common-sense notion of singular <br><br>
